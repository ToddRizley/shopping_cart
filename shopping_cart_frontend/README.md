Hello! This is the front-end of my small shopping cart app. The front end relies on React to handle the view layer with Redux to handle the data flow. I used React Router to handle routing. The app communicates with the shopping_cart_backend which utilizes the Rails 5 JSON API repo link here: https://github.com/ToddRizley/shopping_cart/tree/master/shopping_cart_backend

Check the parent repo for info on how to run the application locally: https://github.com/ToddRizley/shopping_cart
